						[Some developers] seem to find writing cover letters too tedious to bother with. Instead, they&rsquo;ll find jobs through networking, or the jobs will just come to them. Personally, I would be highly dubious of a company that hires simply based on who you know. That seems like the kind of company where you end up working with the boss&rsquo;s nephew who is &ldquo;good with computers&rdquo;. A company&rsquo;s hiring process is usually a pretty good indicator of what kind of talent it employs, and thus the kind of quality the company has.

								Less an opinion than a summary of the discussion that’s flared up since XHTML2 was killed earlier this month.
							</p>
							<p>
								As this developer sees it, a lot of people seem to have confused a couple of awesome HTML5 features — standards-based video embedding, client-side database support, cool new structural tags like <code>header</code> — for the spec as a whole. The new HTML 5&nbsp;<em>features</em> are undeniably awesome, and hopefully we won’t have to wait till 2015 to enjoy them. But having to use classes or IDs to denote sidebars or dialogue is hardly the most annoying or problematic thing about HTML, and the idea that if WHATWG disagrees with a change they can just fork the spec is simply insane.

								Two discoveries made today:
							</p>
							<h3>
								Parking my bike two blocks away from work
							</h3>
							<p>
								Since starting my new job three weeks ago I’ve been using the ample bike parking outside my new office, which so happens to be at Michigan Ave/South Water St, a straight shot from where I cross the river into downtown at Clark &amp; Wacker.
							</p>
							<p>
								This has worked all right, but has raised a couple of first-world-type problems:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>
										In the mornings I like to grab a coffee from <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/">Intelligentsia</a> on Randolph, two blocks from the office. Riding directly there and walking my bike back is annoying, but then again so is walking there and back after parking my bike.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Michigan Avenue at five o’clock is <em>hell</em> for cyclists. It is literally faster to walk my bike back down to Randolph than to try riding around the huge buses, tired commuters and insane cabbies. (My route home takes me back to Wicker Park via Randolph, Halsted and Milwaukee, plus some side streets.)
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Can you see the common element here? It took me until this morning to realize it: that I could simply <em>park on Randolph</em>, across from Intelligentsia and that would make everything simpler. I even parked on the right side of the street so I could more easily just hop on and immediately have a clear path to start riding west.
							</p>
							<h3>
								Holding the bread
							</h3>
							<p>
								Did you know that a typical <a href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com/">Jimmy John’s</a> club sandwich has over 750 calories? I didn’t realize it until a few weeks ago, when I grabbed one for dinner, then had to input the nutritional info into <a href="http://www.freshapps.com/lose-it/">Lose It!</a> and realized one sandwich (plus a bag of reduced fat chips) had blown away half my daily calorie budget.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since then I’ve tried to avoid those delicious JJ’s sandwiches, a greater challenge now because my new office <em>has a Jimmy John’s in the lobby</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Anyway, I remembered they offer something called an “UnWich”, which is their name for a sandwich wrapped in lettuce instead of bread. It turns out that the bread alone on one of their ‘Giant Club Sandwiches’ accounts for more than <em>300 calories</em>. The #16 Club Lulu (with double helpings of turkey and bacon) is 790 calories on a sub roll, but just <em>455 calories</em> wrapped in lettuce.
							</p>
							<p>
								300 calories is, for me, almost a full breakfast. More to the point: it’s 2/3rds of a cookie. The sub roll, my least favorite part of the sandwich, is something I can easily drop from my diet to make room for <em>more cookies.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
								So, I ordered the UnWich version of that sandwich, and it was <em>delicious</em>. The lettuce was crispy, and the turkey and bacon were even more flavorful for not being surrounded by a huge mass of bread.
